# Deep Learning for Porosity Prediction
This is a repository containing a feedforward neural network model for predicting porosity using synthetic geophysical data, created by [Professor Michael Pyrcz](https://zenodo.org/records/5564874).

Note: this is the first of several repositories that will be uploaded. These repositories are currently being recovered and updated.
